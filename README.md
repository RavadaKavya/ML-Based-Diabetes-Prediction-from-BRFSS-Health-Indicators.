Title: ML-Based Diabetes Prediction from BRFSS Health Indicators.

Introduction
Diabetes is a long-term medical condition affecting millions worldwide. Early screening and intervention can significantly improve outcomes for those at risk. This project aims to develop a Python-based machine-learning model capable of analyzing multiple health indicators to predict the likelihood of diabetes onset.

Problem Statement
The main objective of this initiative is to utilize machine learning algorithms to develop a model that can effectively predict the possibility of an individual developing diabetes by analyzing various health indicators extracted from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015.

Implementation Plan
We will use the following approach to implement the project:
Data Preprocessing: Utilize Pandas for data loading, cleaning, and one-hot encoding of categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Implement feature selection techniques to identify relevant features.
Model Training: Employ various machine learning classifiers such as RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, GaussianNB, and LogisticRegression from the SKLearn package.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Conduct GridSearch to optimize model hyperparameters.
Evaluation: Measure the performance using accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and ROC AUC.

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), i.e., https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators, and is available publicly. The dataset includes various health indicators as features and diabetes status as the target variable.

Conclusion
This project will leverage machine learning techniques to address a significant healthcare issue, offering a valuable tool for early diabetes risk assessment and contributing to the broader healthcare field.
